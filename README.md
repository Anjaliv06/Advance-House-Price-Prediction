# 🏠 Advance House Price Prediction

This project focuses on predicting house prices using various machine learning techniques. The workflow includes Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), feature engineering, feature selection, model training, and evaluation.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

To build a predictive model that can accurately estimate the selling price of houses using advanced regression techniques and well-engineered features.

## 🔍 Project Workflow

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Dataset overview
- Missing values, outliers
- Target variable distribution
- Correlation analysis
- Initial visualizations

### 2. Feature Engineering
- Handling missing values
- Encoding categorical features
- Skewness reduction using log transform
- Creating new meaningful features

### 3. Feature Selection
- Removing redundant or highly correlated features
- Using feature importance from tree-based models

### 4. Model Training & Evaluation
- Train/test split
- Model comparison (Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, Random Forest, etc.)
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Final model evaluation using RMSE
